# BugLife
------------------------------------------
BugLife is a Frogger arcade clone game. It was built to improve my JavaScript skills as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.
You can try online version [here](http://nataliatepluhina.github.io/Nanodegree/Classic%20Arcade%20Game%20Clone/dist/index.html)

## Goal  
The main objective is to pass through three levels and meet the bug princess at the end. You need the avoid enemies and collect the keys to open the door to the next level - and princess' heart as well!

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the player up, down, left and right. When you collide with the human, your position will reset. Refresh the page after the end of the game if you want to replay.
